    <h2>Article 1</h2>
<p>This is the first time I'm working with colours in css. would it be fun? I have no idea if it will, but I have a feeling it will.</p>



<h2>Article 2</h2>
<p>I'm also learning to write with the keyboard, it's a bit hard because, I haven't done that before, so I'm getting a hang of it, but, it's going to take quite sometime, before, I get used to it completely sooooo yaaaaay</p> 


<h2>Article 3</h2>
<p>I'm hugry, and ther's nothing to eat just yet. It's quite sad really, but I know, I'll soon find something to eat, but it might take a while before that happens, you see I'm busy with a work that I'm doing right now, and that might take a huge part of my day today.</p>
